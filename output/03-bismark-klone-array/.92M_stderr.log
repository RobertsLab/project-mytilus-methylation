Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.5.4])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/srlab/programs/samtools-1.20/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is ../01-bismark-init/	(absolute path is '/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/project-mytilus-methylation/output/01-bismark-init/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)
Attention: early reports suggested that high values of -p  to have diminishing returns. Please test different values using a small subset of data for your hardware setting.
Each Bowtie 2 instance is going to be run with 8 threads. Please monitor performance closely and tune down if necessary!

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/project-mytilus-methylation/output/03-bismark-klone-array'):
../../data/raw-wgbs/92M_1.fastq.gz
../../data/raw-wgbs/92M_2.fastq.gz
Library was specified to be not strand-specific (non-directional), therefore alignments to all four possible bisulfite strands (OT, CTOT, OB and CTOB) will be reported
Output will be written into the directory: /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/project-mytilus-methylation/output/03-bismark-klone-array/
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)

Summary of all aligner options:	-q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Current working directory is: /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/project-mytilus-methylation/output/03-bismark-klone-array

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/sr320/github/project-mytilus-methylation/output/01-bismark-init/

Single-core mode: setting pid to 1

Paired-end alignments will be performed
=======================================

The provided filenames for paired-end alignments are ../../data/raw-wgbs/92M_1.fastq.gz and ../../data/raw-wgbs/92M_2.fastq.gz
Input files are in FastQ format
Writing a C -> T converted version of the input file 92M_1.fastq.gz to 92M_1.fastq.gz_C_to_T.fastq
Writing a G -> A converted version of the input file 92M_1.fastq.gz to 92M_1.fastq.gz_G_to_A.fastq

Created C -> T as well as G -> A converted versions of the FastQ file 92M_1.fastq.gz (93182201 sequences in total)
